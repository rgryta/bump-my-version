> **NOTE**
>
> This is a maintained refactor of the [bump2version fork](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) of the excellent [bumpversion project](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion). The main goals of this refactor were:
>
> - Add support for `pyproject.toml` configuration files.
> - Convert to [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) for and [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for the CLI interface
> - Add better configuration validation using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev)
> - Make the code and tests easier to read and maintain

- Manage project versioning through the project's development life cycle
    - Incrementing version numbers
    - serializing version numbers
    - parsing version numbers
    - supporting SemVer, CalVer, and other versioning schemes
- Modify project files as part of the project's development life cycle
- Work with the project's source control system
    - Committing changes
    - Tagging releases
    - Reading version numbers from tags

## Installation

You can download and install the latest version of this software from the Python package index (PyPI) as follows:

```console
pip install --upgrade bump-my-version
```

## Changelog

## Semantic versioning example
<!--tutorial start-->

### Create a default configuration

The default configuration uses a simplified version of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

```console title="Generating a default configuration"
$ bump-my-version sample-config --no-prompt --destination .bumpversion.toml
$ cat .bumpversion.toml
[tool.bumpversion]
current_version = "0.1.0"
parse = "(?P<major>\\d+)\\.(?P<minor>\\d+)\\.(?P<patch>\\d+)"
serialize = ["{major}.{minor}.{patch}"]
search = "{current_version}"
replace = "{new_version}"
regex = false
ignore_missing_version = false
tag = false
sign_tags = false
tag_name = "v{new_version}"
tag_message = "Bump version: {current_version} → {new_version}"
allow_dirty = false
commit = false
message = "Bump version: {current_version} → {new_version}"
commit_args = ""
```

### Visualize the versioning path

You can see the potential versioning paths with the `show-bump` subcommand.

```console title="Showing the potential versioning path"
$ bump-my-version show-bump
0.1.0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 1.0.0
               ├─ minor ─ 0.2.0
               ╰─ patch ─ 0.1.1
$ bump-my-version show-bump 1.2.3
1.2.3 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 2.0.0
               ├─ minor ─ 1.3.0
               ╰─ patch ─ 1.2.4
```

The default configuration only allows bumping the major, minor, or patch version. What if you wanted to support pre-release versions?

### Add support for pre-release versions

Alter the `parse` configuration to support pre-release versions. This `parse` option uses an extended (or verbose) regular expression to extract the version components from the current version. 

```toml title="New parse configuration"
parse = """(?x)
    (?P<major>0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.
    (?P<minor>0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.
    (?P<patch>0|[1-9]\\d*)
    (?:
        -                             # dash separator for pre-release section
        (?P<pre_l>[a-zA-Z-]+)         # pre-release label
        (?P<pre_n>0|[1-9]\\d*)        # pre-release version number
    )?                                # pre-release section is optional
"""
```

Alter the `serialize` configuration to support pre-release versions.

```toml title="New serialize configuration"
serialize = [
    "{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{pre_l}{pre_n}",
    "{major}.{minor}.{patch}",
]
```

Add a new configuration section for the `pre_l` part.

```toml title="New pre_l configuration"

[tool.bumpversion.parts.pre_l]
values = ["dev", "rc", "final"]
optional_value = "final"
```

### Visualize the new versioning path

Now when you run `bump-my-version show-bump`, you can see the new pre-release versioning path.

```console title="Showing the new versioning path"
$ bump-my-version show-bump
0.1.0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 1.0.0-dev0
               ├─ minor ─ 0.2.0-dev0
               ├─ patch ─ 0.1.1-dev0
               ├─ pre_l ─ invalid: The part has already the maximum value among ['dev', 'rc', 'final'] and cannot be bumped.
               ╰─ pre_n ─ 0.1.0-final1
```

The `pre_l` is not bump-able because it is already at the maximum value. The `pre_n` is bump-able because it is not at the maximum value.

If we run `bump-my-version show-bump 1.0.0-dev0`, we can see the new versioning path for a `dev` starting version.

```console title="Showing the new versioning path for a dev version"
$ bump-my-version show-bump 1.0.0-dev0
1.0.0-dev0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 2.0.0-dev0
                    ├─ minor ─ 1.1.0-dev0
                    ├─ patch ─ 1.0.1-dev0
                    ├─ pre_l ─ 1.0.0-rc0
                    ╰─ pre_n ─ 1.0.0-dev1
```

Finally, we can see the new versioning path for a `rc` starting version.

```console title="Showing the new versioning path for an rc version"
$ bump-my-version show-bump 1.0.0-rc0 
1.0.0-rc0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 2.0.0-dev0
                   ├─ minor ─ 1.1.0-dev0
                   ├─ patch ─ 1.0.1-dev0
                   ├─ pre_l ─ 1.0.0
                   ╰─ pre_n ─ 1.0.0-rc1
```

The full development and release path is:

- `1.0.0`
- `bump patch` → `1.0.1-dev0`
- `bump pre_n` → `1.0.1-dev1`
- `bump pre_l` → `1.0.1-rc0`
- `bump pre_n` → `1.0.1-rc1`
- `bump pre_l` → `1.0.1`

1. You must decide on the next version before you start developing.
2. Development versions increase using `bump-my-version bump pre_n`.
3. Switch from development to release candidate using `bump-my-version bump pre_l`.
4. Release candidates increase using `bump-my-version bump pre_n`.
5. Switch from the release candidate to the final release using `bump-my-version bump pre_l`.

### Automate the pre-release numbering

The `pre_n` or pre-release number is a number that increases with each pre-release. You can automate this by changing the serialization configuration.

```toml title="Serialize configuration with pre_n automation"
serialize = [
    "{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{pre_l}{distance_to_latest_tag}",
    "{major}.{minor}.{patch}",
]
```

The `distance_to_latest_tag` is a special value that is replaced with the number of commits since the last tag. This is a good value to use for the `pre_n` because it will always increase with each commit.

### Visualize the pre_n versioning path

Now when you run `bump-my-version show-bump`, you can see the new pre-release versioning path.

```console title="Showing the new versioning path with pre_n automation"
$ bump-my-version show-bump
0.1.0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 1.0.0-dev0
               ├─ minor ─ 0.2.0-dev0
               ├─ patch ─ 0.1.1-dev0
               ╰─ pre_l ─ invalid: The part has already the maximum value among ['dev', 'rc', 'final'] and cannot be bumped.
$ bump-my-version show-bump 1.0.0-dev0
1.0.0-dev0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 2.0.0-dev0
                    ├─ minor ─ 1.1.0-dev0
                    ├─ patch ─ 1.0.1-dev0
                    ╰─ pre_l ─ 1.0.0-rc0
$ bump-my-version show-bump 1.0.0-rc0 
1.0.0-rc0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─ 2.0.0-dev0
                   ├─ minor ─ 1.1.0-dev0
                   ├─ patch ─ 1.0.1-dev0
                   ╰─ pre_l ─ 1.0.0
```

The `pre_n` path is now missing because it is automated.

The full development and release path now is:

- `1.0.0`
- `bump patch` → `1.0.1-dev0`
  - each commit will increase → `1.0.1-dev1`
- `bump pre_l` → `1.0.1-rc0`
  - each commit will increase → `1.0.1-rc1`
- `bump pre_l` → `1.0.1`

1. You must decide on the next version before you start developing.
2. Development versions increase automatically with each commit.
3. Switch from development to release candidate using `bump-my-version bump pre_l`.
4. Release candidate versions increase automatically with each commit.
5. Switch from the release candidate to the final release using `bump-my-version bump pre_l`.

### GitHub Actions

You can use `bump-my-version` as part of a GHA workflow. Here is an example of a workflow that bumps the version, commits the change, and tags the commit.

```yaml title="GitHub Actions Workflow"
name: Bump version

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Bump version
        uses: callowayproject/bump-my-version@master
        with:
          args: "major"
```

Inputs for the bump-my-version action are:
1. `args` - The arguments to pass to the `bump-my-version bump [args]` command. See the CLI documentation for more information.
2. `github-token` - The GitHub token to use for committing and tagging. This is optional.

Output:
1. `bump` - Boolean flag for whether the version was bumped.
2. `version` - [TODO] The new version number.

This GitHub action performs push in such a way, that if there's a different workflow set up to run on push, it will run for that new `ref`.
